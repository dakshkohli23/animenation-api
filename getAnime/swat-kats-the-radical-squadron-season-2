	"description": "Swat Kats: The Radical Squadron was a short-lived cartoon show produced by Hanna-Barbera that first aired in September 1993. It revolved around the feline characters of Megakat City, and its two main characters were Jake Clawson and Chance Furlong, two pilots who were thrown out of the enforcers due to a mishap and forced to work as junkyard auto mechanics to repay the damages they caused. They decided they had to do more to make amends, and therefore, Jake Clawson designed the Turbokat and became the vigilantes known was the SWAT Kats. Jake, a.k.a Razor, was the weapons system officer and Chance, a.k.a T-bone, was the pilot. Together they protected Megakat City from many foes, such as Dark Kat, Dr. Viper, The Pastmaster, Mac and Molly, a.k.a. The Metallikats, and Hard Drive.",

With the city submerged in slime and infested by huge, repulsive mutants, the Swat Kats must undertake a perilous mission to Megakat Biochemical Labs, where they must retrieve the antimutagens needed to restore everything to normal. T-Bone, who can't swim, nearly drowns in the slime, and later becomes a mutant himself when one of the creatures bites him. Worse, Dr. Viper eventually uses the katalyst on himself, turning into a skyscraper-sized monstrosity.",

But the worst part is that the Swat Kats' future selves are dead, killed by the Metallikats when they took over. Now, it's up to the pilots from the past to set things right. But when the older Callie and Mayor Manx are kidnapped by the Metallitack Units, the Swat Kats form an uneasy alliance with the Pastmaster, who wants revenge against Mac and Molly for doublecrossing him. Together with Commander Feral and Felina, they storm Metallikat Headquarters.",

Obviously the Swat Kats are having none of this nonsense. When T-Bone both outflies the Omega Squadron and successfully recovers from the effects of the Vertigo Beam, Turmoil is impressed. She attempts to persuade him to join her side, and, truly remarkably, he accepts; first, though, he must prove his loyalty... by killing Razor!",

Meanwhile, Hard Drive has somehow escaped and steals a recently invented anti-weapons scrambler from Pumadyne scientist Dr. Ohm. With this, Hard Drive prepares to steal the gold being transferred from the Megakat Mint to the City's banks on the newly constructed Megakat Railway. The SWAT Kats come to stop him, but all of their weapons are disabled by the weapons scramber. It is up to T-Bone and Razor to outwit rather than outgun their opponent and retrieve the gold.",

Zyme leaves the lab and Purvis steals the mutagen and its research for himself, only to be discovered by Zyme and pursued into the building's stairwell. Purvis trips down the stairs and becomes covered in the growth formula. He then collapses, supposedly dead and is taken to the morgue. Dr. Zyme discovers that the mutagen is ineffective and mutates its host into an evil monstrosity. Purvis is mutated by the formula and becomes Dr. Viper, taking his name from the mutagen itself.
