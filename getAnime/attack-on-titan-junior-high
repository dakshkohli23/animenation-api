Annie approaches him in class, and a similar letter falls from her pocket, but she runs away before he can ask her about it. Later, they find her putting the letter in his locker: when Jean opens it, he finds a message asking him to meet at the park, and runs off. Annie then arrives at the park, and reveals that the letter was not from her, but from a Titan who fell in love with Jean after he gave it food as a distraction while he and Marco fled. Much to his classmates horror, Jean refuses to accept reality, instead convincing himself that the Titan is a normal girl. He soon comes to his senses, however, and rejects her; she smashes him into the ground and runs away, vowing not to give up. Sasha tries to console him by pretending that two pieces of food are girls who want to date him, and he retreats into fantasy. The others go home, leaving Marco to wait for Jean to come to his senses.",

On the third operation, shaved ice was almost spilled on Annie but Bertholdt rushes towards her in time to only get himself soaked instead. After he washed himself, he heads towards a die-cutting stall out of interest while the group tries desperately to find him. Only Annie seemed to know where he was and the owner of the die-cutting stall gives Bertholdt two masks as he thought that Bertholdt and Annie were dating. Bertholdt blushes hard and tells him that that was not the case. The two sit on a bench at the area where the entire group was supposed to meet. She does not know what to say to describe Bertholdt when he is with her and she ends up laughing after what Bertholdt commented. Sasha was about to call out to them but Reiner and Ymir hold her back. In the end, Bertholdt confesses his feelings towards Annie and replies with a 'yes'. Just then, the group hiding and eavesdropping fall out of the bushes and Reiner and Ymir congratulates Bertholdt and Annie. Bertholdt suggest they go back for die-cutting which leave Reiner and Ymir in confusion. While they are die-cutting, fireworks appear in the sky and everyone is in awe.",
