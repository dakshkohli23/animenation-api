		"title": "Pingu is Introduced",
		"description": "The episode begins as the family is enjoying their lunch. Pingu tries to scoop up his potatoes but is having great difficulty, so he smashes his fork which makes it easier to swallow them whole. Father scolds him, but then ends up showing how difficult it is for him to keep his potatoes on his fork too. Pingu laughs and blows bubbles into his drink, with Mother telling him off for it. He then moves on to his fish which he puts into his mouth and pulls up again to reveal the bones. He does not want to eat his greens, but Father tells him he must if he wants to leave the table. Once finally eaten through his straw, Pingu rushes to the bathroom and spits the greens into the toilet. Pingu exits the bathroom and the table is cleared, so he slides under the table and sneaks into the toybox, to find his red rubber ball. He asks Father to inflate it for him, so he fetches the pump and does so. While he waits, Mother lets Pingu have a lick of her ice lolly. Pingu finally goes outside with his ball, sets it down and goes back in to blow his nose. While Pingu is gone, two bullies named Pingo and Pingg come along and steal the ball. Pingu soon returns and a big fight ensues to rescue his ball, resulting with Pingg hitting Pingu on the head and Pingo tripping Pingu up onto the ball, causing it to burst. Pingu runs back to his igloo, chased by snowballs thrown at him by Pingo. Father blows up the ball again while Mother puts a plaster on Pingu's head. Father also plasters up the damage that the ball suffered too. Pingu then finishes off the day with a sleep in his hammock.",

At first he is proud and happy to help, but he quickly gets bored, and gets up and starts listening to music called "Woodpeckers From Space". He does dances and other steps, but the egg suddenly sprouts a leg and starts to dance around the house. When Pingu notices this, he tries to stop things and catch the egg before his parents find out, trashing the igloo in the process. Pingu's parents, eventually noticing the commotion and finding out what's happening, rush over to help. Father catches the egg and mother turns off the record. Mother finds Pingu hiding in a cupboard beneath the record player; afraid his parents would be angry at him. They are not, however, and mother hugs him. Mother and Pingu clean up the igloo and Father sews him a hat for a great job taking care of the egg.",

		"description": "Pingu is going fishing; he climbs down a series of cliffs into a craggy, secluded area and finds an ice-fishing hole. He catches a fish, but he is unaware that Robby the seal, behind him, is emerging from another hole that the one Pingu is fishing at connects to, eating the bait, and snatching and attaching the same fish to the line each time. Pingu finds out and foxes Robby by luring him away from the ice holes and closing them off with large slabs of ice. A high-speed acrobatic chase ensues and Robby tries desperately to escape the young penguin by forcing his way under the ice-slab which stands between him and freedom. When Pingu tries to stop him by shouting at him, Robby's right flipper briefly gets trapped, and the weeping seal seems severely hurt. Pingu is struck with remorse and sympathy, consoling Robby before his flipper is 'miraculously' healed. Robby recognizes the goodness in Pingu's soul and rewards his sensitivity with a much larger fish.",

Despite mother's efforts, Pinga does not want to go to bed - until mother rocks her to sleep. Pingu goes to his mum for help with his blocks, but she is too busy knitting clothing for Pinga. Pingu looks at Pinga, who notices that she is in bed. She starts to cry and is comforted and given attention by mother, who continues to apparently ignore Pingu. Pingu desperately tries to get attention by behaving like a baby, kicking a chamberpot around, and pretending to be a ghost, but he gives up and hides in the toy box. Mother soon puts Pinga back in bed, which Pinga still doesn't want to do. Realising that Pingu feels neglected, mother apologizes and hugs him, and he goes to sleep with Pinga.",

		"description": "Robby the seal jokingly attacks Pingu with snowballs. Pingu is enticed immediately to join an acrobatic game in which a large pink fish is the object of their japery. Pingu, in a bizarre moment of claustrophobic inertia, finds the fish's mouth trapped over his head and Robby, briefly abandoning his joking around, aids his relatively new friend by removing the fish from Pingu's head. They then play a tennis-style game using the fish. However, the fish is eventually caught on the rope and, after a futile attempt to retrieve the fish, Pingu retrieves it using a pair of ice-stilts placed conveniently by his igloo. Robby strips the fish of its skin and flesh and divides fish in totally equal parts.",

Pingu comes around and he and Robby play with the sledge-barrel. They go down a long and winding hill two times, with Robby being the brakes - almost crashing into a sculpture both times. Unfortunately, when they go down a third time, they lose control, and Robby falls off and Pingu crashes into the sculpture which collapses over him, trapping him inside. Robby goes for help, and gets an emergency paramedic to lift a slab of ice from the rubble in order for Robby to slide under and get Pingu. He gets Pingu out just before the paramedic's arms give way to the weight of the slab. The paramedic then puts a patch on Pingu's head, and he, Robby, and the paramedic leave.",

Pingu brushes the bathtub instead of his teeth, then knocks Pinga's potty, and mum finally manages to get them to go to the bedroom. At first they tried to leave when she wasn't looking. They keep demanding things such as a teddy, pacifier, fish, or bottles. When she stops coming to their demands (though Pinga made one), they go out to find their exasperated mother asleep. They move her into the bedroom and finally go to sleep all together",

He puts it back on and finds it looking like a Rhino's horn when he turns the head. He then sits on a sledge and starts drumming on his belly, when he sees Pingo coming along on his new skis. Pingu, most impressed, decides to tag along with him and, not having a pair of skis of his own, uses some junk in a ruined igloo to build a make-shift pair of his own. Pingu and Pingo then go climbing one of the mountains, with Pingo nearly slipping. After having fun whizzing about down the mountain, with Pingo taunting Pingu, they start racing competitively with Pingo going first, Pingu going next, with both stopping at one point, and both of them end up breaking their skis. They put what they can back together, and then decide to go with each of them on only one ski and go home, arm-in-arm, singing instead.",
