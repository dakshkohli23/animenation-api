	"description": "In a world where magic is everything, Asta and Yuno are both found abandoned at a church on the same day. While Yuno is gifted with exceptional magical powers, Asta is the only one in this world without any. At the age of fifteen, both receive grimoires, magic books that amplify their holder’s magic. Asta’s is a rare Grimoire of Anti-Magic that negates and repels his opponent’s spells. Being opposite but good rivals, Yuno and Asta are ready for the hardest of challenges to achieve their common dream: to be the Wizard King. Giving up is never an option!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

Vanessa leaves to visit Finral, Magna leaves to train alone and Charmy leaves to search for new ingredients. Gauche, Grey and Gordon remain behind. Gauche becomes interested in why all the rooms keep rearranging and recalls stories Charmy and Vanessa told of seeing a ghost. The base is suddenly attacked by zombies summoned by Rades Spirito, along with Sally and Valtos. Gauche destroys the zombies before learning from Sally that Licht has forbidden them from killing him. Sally reinforces one of the zombies, making it more powerful, but it is destroyed by Gordon’s poison magic. She tries to attack with her gel salamander, but Grey uses transformation magic to turn the gel to crystal, which Gauche shatters. Rades summons a new zombie, No. 0 Mikael Caesar, which is made from the corpses of two squad captains and uses both Wind and Plant magic. Zombies swarm into the base, infuriating Grey and Gordon, who consider the base to be their real home, and they both speak loudly and clearly for the first time that they will protect it. An alarm suddenly sounds from the base which violently rearranges itself in response to being invaded, revealing a mage with long, light blue hair concealed inside, who demands to know what is going on.",

The Wizard King asked Yami and Vangeance to deal with a bandit group, hoping to identify a traitorous magic knight. Vangeance spread false information, limiting the number of villages the bandits could attack to only two and sent Yami to one while he went to the other. The bandits attacked Yami’s village and Yami found himself facing the bandit leader who escaped years ago, now armed with a powerful magic staff. Yami defeated him regardless but was trapped by two traitorous magic knights, Goht of the Crimson Lions and Mohl of the Silver Eagles. They attempted to kill Yami to cover up their crimes but Yami was rescued by Vangeance and they defeated the traitors. The Wizard King promoted Yami and Vangeance to Squad Captains. Yami decided to only accept hooligans and outcasts and formed the Black Bulls while Yami formed the Golden Dawn and only accepted strong nobles. Asta fails to see the point of Yami’s story, to never quit no matter how many times Yuno beats him, and is punished for being an idiot. Asta regains his former spirit and joins the other Bulls waiting for the exam results, only for the sudden and violent arrival of Mereoleona of the Crimson Lions.",

While in the bath Yami reminisces about his past when he first joined the Grey Deer squad, now known as the Aqua Deer squad, with the Wizard King as his squad captain. He was hired by villagers to protect their harvest from bandits in exchange for food since the villagers had no money. Yami agreed but while fighting the bandits was overwhelmed by their numbers, until he received help from Captain Vangeance, who at that time was only another member of the Grey Deer’s, not yet a captain. Together they captured all the bandits except the leader who escaped. Before going their separate ways Yami and Vangeance decided to become rivals and see who would become a Squad Captain first, and their rivalry continued for many years afterward.",
