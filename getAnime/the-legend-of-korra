After passing her firebending test, she meets with Tenzin, Aang's son and the only Air Bending Master, who is supposed to be her Air Bending Teacher. However, due to tense circumstances in Republic City, he tells her that her training must wait, so that he can tend to his duties in the City. Not wanting to wait, Korra sneaks out of the South Pole and heads to Republic City where she finds herself in over her head.",
